# CS-2336-Java (2020 Spring Semester)
### Java course taught by Prof. Jason Smith at UT Dallas
### Project Discriptions
* Project 0 - Custom file parsing to compute string of specific characters and interpret them into baseball stats for individual players
* Project 1 - Novice level AI implementation of computer vision. Detects specific characters and makes calculated moves depending on surrounding enviornment. Basically a predetor and prey simulation that shows eviornment over prolonged generations. Follows AI Abastraction Methodology.
* Project 2 - Update Project 0 with revamped file parsor to accomodate larger data sets and uses linked list class
* Project 3 - Integral calculator thats able to compute signed integrals with signed exponents to any N powers. Able to also calculate trig expressions (sin and cos). Ability to integrate definate and indefinate integrals. Uses generic binary tree class with comparable nodes. 
* Project 4 - Update Project 0 with revamped file parsor to accomodate larger data sets. Now uses generic hashtable that implements double hashing algorithm.
